Goal is to ensure that a bank maintains enough high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to survive a period of significant stress.

HQLA: Assets that can be easily and quickly converted into cash with little or no loss of value (e.g., government bonds, certain corporate bonds, cash reserves).

Net Cash Outflows: Expected cash outflows minus expected cash inflows over a 30-day stress scenario.

Requirement:
Banks must maintain LCR ≥ 100%.
This means they should have enough liquid assets to cover net outflows for at least 30 days of stress.

👉 In simple terms:
LCR makes sure banks don’t run out of cash during short-term stress by forcing them to keep a liquidity buffer.
